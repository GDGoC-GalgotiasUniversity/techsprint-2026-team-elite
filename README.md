## 🎯 Problem Statement
Many students and individuals struggle to maintain consistency in daily habits due to lack of simple tracking and visual feedback.
* **Context:** Existing habit trackers are complex, paid, or require heavy backend setups.
* **Impact:** Users lose motivation, fail to track progress, and abandon habits early.

## 💡 Solution
A frontend-driven **Activity Tracker** that uses **Google Sheets as a backend** to track activities month-wise and visualize progress.
1. **Simple Daily Tracking:** Checkbox-based activity logging for each day of the month.
2. **Automatic Calculations:** Counts and streaks are computed dynamically on the frontend.
3. **Visual Progress:** Interactive line charts to show completion trends.
